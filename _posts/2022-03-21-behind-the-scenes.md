## Introduction

Prior to 2020, most data sprints were held in person during intensive 8-hour-long days. Data Umbrella founder, Reshama Shaikh, for example, led several in-person sprints in New York (2017, 2018, 2019), Nairobi (2019) and San Francisco (2019).

It was clear that an 8-hour in-person event could not just switch to being an 8-hour online event. So the move to online data sprints required the team to rethink the format and mechanisms of the event.
